h2 Work Experience

b Back-End Architect
|  Doit.im 
| 2012 - present

p After collecting the system information, I analyse and discover the bottle-neck. Then I help to scale up the service for increasing number of users, using less CPU power and Network Bandwidth than before.

b Architect & Senior Researcher
|  ShanDa Interactive Entertainment Ltd.
| 2011 – 2012

p I am the Dev-Lead and manager of project "Fingerprinting and Tracking of Online Literature Works".
p I design and build the whole system, including:
ul
    li How to discover related web page and crawl the site. (This needs to deal with thousands of different sites)
    li How to extract unique digital fingerprint of literature database. (And keep extracted feature small)
    li How to fast and correctly compare the target web page. (Quickly filter out no-match candidates)
    li How to present the useful data from match result. (Use diagram to help people explore the data)

b Lead Software Developer
|  Vobile
|  2005 - 2011

p Vobile's VDNA® (VideoDNA) technology is the gold standard in video content fingerprinting and identification. It has been adopted by all major Hollywood studios and TV networks.

p As one of the first employees, I develop the groundbreaking product and service based on the VDNA® technology.

p I build a C++ multithreaded application to:
ul
    li Accept network request from many clients
    li Dispatch requests to several workers, which process the query (CPU bound)
    li Merge and filter the result using a trained neural network model (the model improves accuracy through iteration)
